This is an easy-to-install linear algebra library. It consists of two major classes, _**Vec**_ standing for vector
and _**Mat**_ standing for matrix together with a set of accompanying functions and operations.
This library might be useful for projects within the field of signal/image processing,
machine learning, and in general in any kind of academic/scientific project.

## Documentation
To get started check the [wiki](https://github.com/IoannisKaragiannis/LinearAlgebra/wiki).

## Recuirements



## LOG FILE

Assuming you are using Linux, an error-log file will be stored under the
/tmp/LinearAlgebra/ directory. This will be helpful to detect bugs in your
code related to *LinearAlgebra* lib. If you are working on an OS other than Linux
the functions within *mylog.h* file will not work. As I haven't tested this library on Windows
or Mac OS, I cannot guarantee anything.

# DEMO

Look at the [demo](https://github.com/IoannisKaragiannis/LinearAlgebra/tree/master/demo) folder.


So, now you must have familiriazed yourself with the *LinearAlgebra* library. Start your exciting project and don't forget to say a good word for me.

P.S.: There are several linear algebra libraries out there way more complete and probably better performing than mine (e.g.: itpp, armadillo, eigen, etc.). But this is just a project I wanted to work on and share it with you. Cheers.
