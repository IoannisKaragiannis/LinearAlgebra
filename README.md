This is an easy-to-install linear algebra library. It consists of two major classes, _**Vec**_ standing for vector
and _**Mat**_ standing for matrix together with a set of accompanying functions and operations.
This library might be useful for projects within the field of signal/image processing,
machine learning, and in general in any kind of academic/scientific project.

## Documentation
To get started check the [wiki](https://github.com/IoannisKaragiannis/LinearAlgebra/wiki).

## Recuirements
- OS: Linux. Library is tested only on Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04.
- IDE: Eclipse. The instructions I provide in [wiki](https://github.com/IoannisKaragiannis/LinearAlgebra/wiki) are meant for Eclipse. You should figure out yourselves how to apply these instructions on different IDEs.


## LOG FILE

Assuming you are using Linux, an error-log file will be stored under the
/tmp/LinearAlgebra/ directory. This will be helpful to detect bugs in your
code related to *LinearAlgebra* lib. If you are working on an OS other than Linux
the functions within *mylog.h* file will not work. As I haven't tested this library on Windows
or Mac OS, I cannot guarantee anything.
