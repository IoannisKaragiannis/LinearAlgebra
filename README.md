This is an easy-to-install linear algebra library. It consists of two major classes, _**Vec**_ standing for vector
and _**Mat**_ standing for matrix together with a set of accompanying functions and operations.
This library might be useful for projects within the field of signal/image processing,
machine learning, and in general in any kind of academic/scientific project.

## Documentation
To get started check the [wiki](https://github.com/IoannisKaragiannis/LinearAlgebra/wiki).

## Recuirements
- OS: Linux. Library is tested only on Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04.
- IDE: Eclipse. The instructions I provide in [wiki](https://github.com/IoannisKaragiannis/LinearAlgebra/wiki) are meant for Eclipse. You should figure out yourselves how to apply these instructions on different IDEs.
